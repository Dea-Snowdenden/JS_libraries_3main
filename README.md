A library is an organized collection of useful functionality. A typical library could include functions to handle strings, dates, HTML DOM elements, events, cookies, animations, network requests, and more. Each function returns values to the calling application which can be implemented however you choose. Think of it like a selection of car components: you’re free to use any to help construct a working vehicle but you must build the engine yourself.

Frameworks
A framework is an application skeleton. It requires you to approach software design in a specific way and insert your own logic at certain points. Functionality such as events, storage, and data binding are normally provided for you. Using the car analogy, a framework provides a working chassis, body, and engine. You can add, remove or tinker with some components presuming the vehicle remains operational.

jQuery remains the most-used JavaScript library ever created and is distributed with WordPress, ASP.NET and several other frameworks. It revolutionized client-side development by introducing CSS selector to DOM node retrieval plus chaining to apply event handlers, animations, and Ajax calls.

> Pros:

> ... small distribution size

> ... shallow learning curve, considerable online help

> ... concise syntax

> ... easy to extend

Cons:

> ... adds a speed overhead to native APIs

> ... less essential now that browser compatibility has improved usage has flat-lined

> ... some industry backlash against unnecessary use.

React
Perhaps the most-talked about library of the past year, React claims to be a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It focuses on the “View” part of Model-View-Controller (MVC) development and makes it easy to create UI components which retain state. It was one of the first libraries to implement a virtual DOM; the in-memory structure computes the differences and updates the page efficiently.

React usage appears low in statistics perhaps because it’s used in applications rather than websites. Almost 38% of developers claim to be using the library.

> Pros:
> ... small, efficient, fast and flexible

> ... simple component model

> ... good documentation and online resources

> ... server-side rendering is possible

> ... currently popular and experiencing rapid growth

> Cons:

> ... new concepts and syntaxes to learn

> ... build tools are essential

> ... can require other libraries or frameworks to provide the model and controller aspects

> ... can be incompatible with code and other libraries which modify the DOM

AngularJS 1.x
Angular is the first framework – or MVC application framework – to appear on
this list. The most popular edition is version 1.x which extended HTML with two-way data-binding while decoupling DOM manipulation from application logic.

Angular 1.x is still in development despite the release of version 2 (which is now version 4!) Confused? See below…

>Pros:

> ...a popular framework adopted by several large companies

> ...a single solution to produce modern web applications

> ...part of the “standard” MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.JS, AngularJS, NodeJS) so many articles and tutorials are
